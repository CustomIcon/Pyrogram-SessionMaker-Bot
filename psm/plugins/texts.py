Follow [Pokurt](https://github.com/pokurt) for more awesome projects like this!
Make sure you give a star to [PSM](https://github.com/pokurt/Pyrogram-SessionMaker-Bot)

**Note**:
Since there will be Forks of this bot I suggest you to make your own one from Source.
I (Pokurt) Personally made this for experimental purposes only, therefore the source is open.
Your phone number and other confidential details are not saved,
However Bot do take `API_ID`, `API_HASH` and `CLOUD_PASSWORD` of user into it's memory buffer to keep the code safe.
User can remove it via Commands given in help menu.
Make sure you clear the chat history of this bot if you do not trust and take a look at the Source itself.
